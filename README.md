# Epsilon-Coefficient-Project

The Epsilon Coefficient Project's concept surrounds the need for addressing an alternative to the beta coefficient. The beta coefficient, in finance, is limited in its ability to incorporate trend prediction into its analysis. The data in its formula, covariance of the stock over the market's variance, only allows room historical data. This has caused controversy over the credibility of the beta coefficient to assess a stock's volitility. Nonetheless, it is still used to assess systematic risk in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and other analytical methods.

The Epsilon Coefficient Project is a fundamental playing ground for incorperating machine learning into methods of assessing systematic risk. The key aspect is the variance formula being twice the value of the cost function. The epsilon coefficent is also used on a daily change, as opposed to a weekly change from the beta coefficient. This allows for a more in-depth analysis of the stock's momentum compared to the market index. 

Further research can include:
- Incorporating additional variable, like sector momentum and news activity, for multivariable linear regression
- Further halving the covariance formula to derive a new equation for gradient descent
- Running simulations to find the best epsilon coefficient for a moderate stock portfolio
- Integration into Proptech and crypto/currency assessments for risk analysis
